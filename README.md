[Introduction to TensorFlow](https://github.com/zs-x/TensorFlowNotes/blob/main/fCC_IntroToTF.ipynb)

How to create and manipulate tensors using `tf.Variable`, understand tensor rank and shape, and perform basic reshaping operations.

[Neural Networks](https://github.com/zs-x/TensorFlowNotes/blob/main/fCC_NeuralNetwork.ipynb)

In this notebook, I build and train a neural network using the Fashion MNIST dataset loaded with `keras.datasets.fashion_mnist`. It includes preprocessing the image data (normalization and reshaping), creating a Sequential model with Flatten and Dense layers, compiling it with an optimizer and loss function, training it with model.fit(), evaluating accuracy on test data, and making predictions on clothing images.

[Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/zs-x/TensorFlowNotes/blob/main/fCC_CNNs.ipynb)

This notebook focuses on building a CNN for image classification. It covers preparing image data with the correct shape, constructing a model using Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers, training the model, evaluating its performance, and comparing results to a basic dense network approach.

[Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/zs-x/TensorFlowNotes/blob/main/fCC_RNN_SentimentAnalysis.ipynb)

In this notebook, I perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset using a recurrent neural network. It includes loading and preprocessing text data, padding sequences, building a model with an Embedding layer and a recurrent layer (such as LSTM), training the model to classify reviews as positive or negative, and evaluating its performance on test data.
